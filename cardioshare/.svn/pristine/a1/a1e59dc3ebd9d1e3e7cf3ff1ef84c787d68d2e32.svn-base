#---------------------------------------------------------------
# This file maps a predicate to a service input/output pair.
# The fields on each line appear in the following order:
#   
# <predicate URI> <service name> [<service authority>] <input article name> <output article name>
#
# None of these fields are allowed to contain whitespace, and 
# use of double or single quotes is not supported.
# 
# You may specify SPARQL-style PREFIX lines so you don't have
# to type out full URIs.  Make sure all the PREFIX lines come at
# the top of the file.
#
# The service authority (e.g. bioinfo.icapture.ubc.ca) identifies
# which party is providing the service.  It is not required, but it
# is sometimes useful to differentiate between two services with
# the same name.   (In the case where there multiple matching services
# and you don't differentiate, the predicate will be assigned to 
# all of them.)
#
# NOTE: Before you can annotate services with a predicate,
# there must a definition for it (in a .defn file).
#
# This file is input for the script 'add_mapping.pl'.
