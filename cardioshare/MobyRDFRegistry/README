--------------------
DEPENDENCIES
--------------------

Note the registry scripts require:

=> A local installation of Virtuoso. (The 'isql' client is needed to load
RDF files into Virtuoso, build indexes on the RDF data, and execute
update queries on the registry data.) 
=> curl (for downloading the Moby registry contents as RDF from Moby Central)

Running the test cases additionally requires installing the following from CPAN:

=> Test::Unit (a unit testing framework)
=> Capture::Tiny (for teeing/capturing output to a variable)

----------------------
DATA FILES
----------------------

*.construct		
	
	Contain CONSTRUCT queries use to build
	RDF triples from Moby output XML objects. See
	the perldoc for 'list_mappings.pl' for
	an explanation (run: "perldoc list_mappings.pl").

*.mappings

 	Contain mappings of predicates to
     	services.  Each mapping is specified
     	on a separate line consisting of
     	fields for:
	     
		<predicate URI> 
     		<Moby service name>
		<service authority>
		<input article name>
		<output article name>
		[<Moby datatype>:<CONSTRUCT query file>]

test/ 
      
        Constains unit tests for the PERL code and
	scripts.

----------------------
PERL SCRIPTS:
----------------------

setup_rdf_registry.pl

	Download the contents of a
	the Moby registry in RDF format,
	and load it into a Virtuoso
	triple store.  At the same time,
	load all predicate mappings given in
	*.mappings files in the local directory.

	NOTE: This script does not build
	RDF indexes.  The indexes are
	crucial for performance and 
	may be set up with setup_rdf_indexes.pl.

add_mappings.pl
	
	Add one or more predicate-to-service
	mappings to the registry.

remove_mappings.pl
	
	Remove one or more predicate-to-service
	mappings from the registry.

list_mappings.pl

	List mappings in the registry. As an exception, 
	this script (and only this script) may be 
	executed against a remote SPARQL endpoint.
		
drop_all_rdf_indexes.pl 
			
	Remove all RDF indexes on the registry.

setup_rdf_indexes.pl
	
	Build the standard set of RDF indexes on
	the registry.
